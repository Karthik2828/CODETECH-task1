Objective

The project aims to process a dataset stored in a CSV file using Pandas. It starts by exploring the data, cleaning it by removing missing values and duplicates, then transforms it by encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features. The code filters the dataset based on specific conditions, aggregates it by grouping, and calculates the mean of numeric columns within each group. Ultimately, the processed dataset is saved to a new CSV file, ensuring its cleanliness and readiness for further analysis.

Key Activities:

1.Load Data: The program begins by loading a dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

2.Explore Data: It explores the loaded dataset by displaying the first few rows, providing information about the columns, and presenting descriptive statistics.

3.Clean Data: The program removes any rows with missing values and eliminates duplicate entries from the dataset to ensure data integrity.

4.Transform Data: It transforms the dataset by encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features, preparing it for analysis.

5.Filter Data: The program filters the dataset based on a specified condition, extracting relevant subsets of data.

6.Aggregate Data: It aggregates the dataset by grouping it according to a specified column and calculating the mean of a numeric column within each group.

7.Save Processed Data: Finally, the program saves the processed dataset into a new CSV file, ready for further analysis, without including the index column.


Technologies used:

1.Pandas: 

Pandas is a powerful open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It is extensively used for data manipulation and analysis tasks, such as loading and exploring data, cleaning and transforming data, and aggregating data.

2.Python: 

Python is the programming language used to write the code. Python is widely used for data analysis and manipulation tasks due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and readability.

3.CSV File:

The code operates on data stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file format. CSV is a common file format used for storing tabular data.

4.Factorization:

The code uses the pd.factorize() function from the Pandas library to encode categorical variables. This function converts categorical variables into numerical representations.

5.Data Filtering and Aggregation: 

The code performs data filtering and aggregation operations using Pandas methods such as DataFrame.groupby() and DataFrame.agg(). These methods enable grouping of data based on specific criteria and performing aggregate functions on grouped data.
